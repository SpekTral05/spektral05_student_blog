<h1 style="color:DarkGrey">About Me</h1>
Hi, my name is Advait!

<p>I'm 15 years old and I like playing video games, but apparently we get to make one in this class so that's cool. In terms of video games, I enjoy playing open world rpg games, mostly on roblox though lol.

  I'd like to learn to make simple games and learn web design, so this class seems fitting. I enjoy playing video games and hanging out with friends in my spare time. I also enjoy doing random projects on little hobbies I enjoy such as building Legos, Gunpla, and doing origami.<p>

  If you want, you can check out my bandlab profile where I make covers of music and some original music too!

<p>I was born in Boston, Massachusetts on November 29, 2009. I moved to New York in 2011 and San Diego in 2015. I went to Del Sur Elementary for elementary school and Oak Valley for middle school. I have a tightknit group of friends that I've been friends with for the last 6 years. Honestly, I couldnt've asked for better friends. Anyway, some games I like to play are Brawl Stars, Roblox, Pok√©mon, and Eve. I love doing anything that requires creativity or patience, but if you meet me in real life you'll think I'm super impatient (lol). Anyway, that's pretty much it.  <p>
