Hi, my name is Advait!

<p>I'm 15 years old and I like playing video games, but apparently we get to make one in this class so that's cool.

  I'd like to learn to make simple games and learn web design, so this class seems fitting. I enjoy playing video games and hanging out with friends in my spare time. I also enjoy doing random projects on little hobbies I enjoy such as building Legos, Gunpla, and doing origami.<p>

<p>I was born in Boston, Massachusetts on November 29, 2009. I moved to New York in 2011 and San Diego in 2015. I went to Del Sur Elementary for elementary school and Oak Valley for middle school. <p>
