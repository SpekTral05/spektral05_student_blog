Hi, my name is Advait!

I'm 15 years old and I like playing video games, but apparently we get to make one in this class so that's cool.

  I'd like to learn to make simple games and learn web design, so this class seems fitting. I enjoy playing video games and hanging out with friends in my spare time. I also enjoy doing random projects on little hobbies I enjoy such as building Legos, Gunpla, and doing origami.
